# ObjectTrackingSMPL
This is a simple object tracking model which we use video footage to ID every object or persons in frame.


Midterm - ENTITY TRACKING
Creator: Jonathan Cruz

Tier 1

I will look to help solve issues like theft in cashierless grocery stores, suspect identifying and to even identify heavy traffic areas in cities via street cameras.


I will be using ultralytics framework to access YOLOv8 to make the process of ID'ing individuals faster and effficiently. Using YOLOv8 we can then track objects or individuals precisely and accurately without having to manually do the work.

Name of the game is object detection,  Yolov8 as my model, Ultralytics as my framework
I will be using these since YOLOv8  does a good job in object detection as far as speed and accuracy for real time video processing, ultralytics since it has built in models such as YOLOv8 so it seemed like the obvious choice.

Your source can be any videos you would like to use since we use COCO dataset which has plenty of labels for entities.

Primary Metric	Accuracy / Precision / Recall	≥ 90 %
Secondary Metric	Speed / FPS / Latency	< 1 s per image
